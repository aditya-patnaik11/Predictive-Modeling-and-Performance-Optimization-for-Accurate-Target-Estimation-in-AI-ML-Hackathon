# Predictive-Modeling-and-Performance-Optimization-for-Accurate-Target-Estimation-in-AI-ML-Hackathon

Problem Statement:
Given a dataset D, which consists of:

Dtrain A matrix of dimension R(m√ón) representing the training data.

Dtest A matrix of dimension R(m1√ón) representing the test data.

We have also provided corresponding target variable Ytrain matrix dimension of R(m√ó1) and 

Ytest   with matrix dimension of R(m1√ó1).

The objective is to construct a predictive model FŒ∏(X)‚Üí Ypred that accurately estimates the target variable Y{i} for new, unseen inputs X{i}

Steps:

Model Construction:
Define a predictive function FŒ∏(X) parameterized by Œ∏ that maps input features X to predicted outputs Ypred.

The model FŒ∏(X) should be designed to capture the relationship between the input features and the target variable effectively.

      2. Training:

Optimize the model parameters Œ∏ by minimizing a loss function L(Y,FŒ∏(X)) using the training data Dtrain

 

Consider incorporating feature transformations, feature engineering, or feature selection to enhance the model‚Äôs predictive performance.

      3. Testing:          

Apply the learned model FŒ∏ *(X) (with optimized parameters ùúÉ‚àó) to the test data Dtest to generate predictions Ypred for each input Xj‚àà{X1,X2,‚Ä¶,Xm1}.

      4. Performance Optimization:

            Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance by calculating accuracy or other relevant metrics M on the test predictions Ypred_test.

Refine the model by iteratively adjusting Œ∏ or modifying  FŒ∏(X) to improve performance on the chosen evaluation metrics M.
